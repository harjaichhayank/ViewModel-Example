# ViewModel-Example
Using ViewModel Architecture to create a NotePad.
The notepad uses MVVM architecture to create a basic notepad.
This notepad includes certain features of adding the title, description, setting up the priority just by clicking the floating add-button
then saving it + sorting the data according to priority in a descending fashion.
The app can even edit the data just by tapping the view object.
The app can delete views either by swipping each view left/right, or simply by clicking the menu to delete all views in one sweep.
